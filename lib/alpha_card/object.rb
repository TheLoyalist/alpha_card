class Object
  # An object is blank if it's false, empty, or a whitespace string.
  # For example, '', '   ', +nil+, [], and {} are all blank.
  #
  # This simplifies
  #
  #   address.nil? || address.empty?
  #
  # to
  #
  #   address.blank?
  #
  # @return [true, false]
  def blank?
    respond_to?(:empty?) ? !!empty? : !self
  end

  # An object is present if it's not blank.
  #
  # @return [true, false]
  def present?
    !blank?
  end

  # Invokes the public method whose name goes as first argument just like
  # +public_send+ does, except that if the receiver does not respond to it the
  # call returns +nil+ rather than raising an exception.
  #
  # This method is defined to be able to write
  #
  #   @person.try(:name)
  #
  # instead of
  #
  #   @person ? @person.name : nil
  #
  # +try+ returns +nil+ when called on +nil+ regardless of whether it responds
  # to the method:
  #
  #   nil.try(:to_i) # => nil, rather than 0

    else
